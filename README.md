# Assignment1PythonRefresher
The first homework assignment for CS3980

In reference to the fibgraph:
    the graph has the time on the y-axis and number of the fib call on the x-axis.
    It increases in load time as it heads toward 100. 
    This is because it has to go through more and more calls to reach the number.
    This is due to recursion.
